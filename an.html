<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overall Ranking</h3>

<p>An-san is a result-oriented developer with good focus on optimization and performance. I also regard his critical thinking skill highly, which is a rare and valuable skill I don't often see in young people. If he's got a good vision and enough room to grow, he'll be a great developer in the future.</p>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tell me about your long term career goals.</h3>

<p>In the far future (5 to 10 more years), I want:
<ul>
  <li>To have some products of my own, such as softwares, apps, services... They could be just for pleasure, or for real money.</li>
  <li>To find a partner and start a small company.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is the biggest challenge we will face this year?</h3>

<p><ul><li>Our revenue-earning team is Research Team, but the team is lacking a true leader with high experiences.</li>
<li>We're having more and more competitors. For example, Q&amp;Me is a new Online Panel company, but it has a lot of money, good branding and marketing strategy.</li></ul></p>

<h3>
<a name="" class="anchor" href="#"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What part of your job do you wish you didn't have to do?
</h3>

<p>Extending or maintaining the old codebase from RunSystem is very exhausting and boring.</p>

<h3>
<a name="" class="anchor" href="#"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What are your top 3 super powers?
</h3>

<p>My top abilities: logical thinking, problem solving, learning new technologies or techniques.</p>

<h3>
<a name="" class="anchor" href="#"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Are you happy with your job now?
</h3>

<p>Yes. Because:<ul>
  <li>Going to work is like following my passion, doing my favorite tasks.</li>
  <li>I'm contributing to the growth of the Company. Be a part of the Company is very interesting.</li>
  <li>I have more chances to learn about new technologies, new techniques and personal development.</li>
  <li>I can work with enthusiastic, creative and helpful people.</li>
  <li>I can have a chance to improve my English.</li>
